variables can be PascalCase vs camelCase [msft] vs traditionnal_unix_way
... I tend to like PascalCase better. Note that WC1 (wingleader) uses the unix way.

classes should be prefixed with a c i.e. cBicycle or c_bicycle
pointers should be prefixed with a p i.e. pBicycle or p_bicycle
(note that the book uses PascalCase for classes and objects, camelCase for variables)
references should be prefixed with a r.

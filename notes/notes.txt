++x and x++ are different, ++ is evaluated before = if written before the variable:
y = x++  // y = (old) x   and  x = x+1
y = ++x; // y = x+1       and  x = x+1

function overloading / function polymorphism:
* same function name, different parameters
* return type can be different as well
* the return type cannot be the ONLY differenciator (parameters must differ as well)

compile with -std=gnu++14
